# Contributing to æ

æ is an open protocol. It belongs to no one and everyone.

---

## How to Contribute

### 1. Read First
- Start with the [README](README.md)
- Review the specs in `/spec`
- Understand the principles before proposing changes

### 2. Open an Issue
Before writing code or specs, open an issue to discuss:
- **RFC proposals** — New protocol features
- **Clarifications** — Things that aren't clear in the spec
- **Use cases** — Real-world scenarios that inform design
- **Questions** — Anything you're uncertain about

### 3. Submit a Pull Request
For spec changes:
- Fork the repository
- Create a branch (`git checkout -b rfc/your-proposal`)
- Write your changes
- Submit a PR with clear explanation

## What We Need

- Feedback on core concepts
- Edge cases we haven't considered
- Real-world use case documentation
- Protocol security analysis

### Soon
- Reference implementation design
- Test suite architecture
- Simulation environment
- Integration guides

### Later
- Implementations in multiple languages
- Client libraries
- Governance structure proposals

## Principles for Contributions

1. **Simplicity over complexity** — The protocol should be minimal
2. **Specification over implementation** — Get the spec right first
3. **Interoperability over features** — Broad adoption beats rich functionality
4. **Transparency over speed** — Discuss openly before merging

---

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful
- Assume good intent
- Focus on the work, not the person
- Welcome newcomers

## Questions?

Open an issue. That's what they're for.
